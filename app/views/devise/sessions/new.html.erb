  <h3>Welcome to WaitList</h3>
  <p>
    WaitList is a simple Web Application that allows restaurants to organize their waiting list. A host/hostess simply needs to gather the name, number, and party size of the incoming party. She/he can then send an SMS as soon as a table is ready for them.
  </p>

  <p>
    The application was built using a Ruby on Rails backend, an AngularJS frontend, the Twilio API for SMS delivery, and Foundation as a styling framework. It was built by me, Raza, in order to convey my understanding of the technologies. You can find out more about me and my other projects on my <a href="http://www.razajafri.info">website</a>.
